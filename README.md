# CO2 Emissions
The CO2 Emissions Predictor is a tool designed to estimate CO2 emissions based on input parameters such as fuel consumption and engine size. It uses a linear regression model that has been trained on relevant datasets. The model's predictions help users understand potential CO2 outputs and make environmentally conscious decisions.

## Features
Based on the following attributes, this Linear Regression Machine Learning Model is capable of estimating the CO2 emitted by various types of vehicles:
- Engine Size of the Vehicle (in CC)
- Number of Cylinders
- Mileage of the Vehicle
  
The model predicts emissions based on these input values and provides an easy-to-use interface for users to get real-time predictions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.1x: The main programming language used in this project.
- Tkinter: To run the GUI (Graphical User Interface)
- Scikit-learn: For building and loading the Linear Regression Model.
- Pandas: FOr handling and processing data
- Numpy: For Numerical Operations. 
- Matplotlib: For Data Visualization.
- Pickle: For saving and loading the ML Model.
